                    Born in Kyoto, Japan, Sakura now lives and works in Brighton, UK. She holds
                    a Master of Arts in Fine Art (with distinction) from the University of Brighton and a Bachelor of
                    Arts in Fashion Design from Central Saint Martins. Her artistic practice centers on painting,
                    drawing inspiration from her everyday experiences and cherished memories.

                    Sakura’s work is profoundly influenced by her mother, Shin Izumi, a Japanese calligrapher who
                    studied at a Buddhist school in Kyoto. Izumi’s philosophy of “letting go” and her emotionally
                    expressive brushwork have significantly shaped Sakura’s own approach to art.

                    A late diagnosis of autism and her journey in overcoming a medical condition, ME/CFS (for which
                    there is no known cure), have led Sakura to a deep self-understanding. This introspection allows her
                    to create art that is authentic and true to herself. From as young as three or four years old,
                    Sakura cherished her own world—a safe and beautiful sanctuary where she could fully be herself,
                    finding joy in serene solitude. When she paints, she retreats to this inner sanctuary, and her
                    childhood memories often emerge in her work.

                    Sakura’s paintings are imbued with emotion, aiming to connect with audiences on a heartfelt level.
                    Through her experiences with autism and ME/CFS, she has become acutely aware of the pressures of
                    societal expectations that we often unknowingly live under. Her work emphasizes the importance of
                    independence from others’ opinions and encourages awareness of one’s true feelings.
